# hangman_rs

Built this Hangman clone on the terminal to help me learn Rust in 2023!

## Usage

You need to have Rust installed in order to play this. You can go to the official website for instructions on installing [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

This project was setup with Cargo, so running the game is very simple. You only need the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomasohCHOM/hangman_rs.git
cd hangman_rs
cargo run
```

Enjoy playing. Thank you for stopping by! :)
